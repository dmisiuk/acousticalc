# AcoustiCalc Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture for AcoustiCalc, a revolutionary terminal calculator that combines Go's performance with an intuitive Text-based User Interface (TUI), mouse support, and audio feedback. The architecture is designed to deliver a calculator experience that's both powerful and accessible to everyday users who work in terminal environments.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

### 2.1 Technical Summary

AcoustiCalc follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **Calculator Engine**: Core mathematical operations and expression parsing
- **TUI Layer**: Terminal-based user interface with mouse support
- **Audio System**: Sound feedback for operations and events
- **Configuration**: Settings management and persistence
- **History/Storage**: Calculation history persistence

The application is built as a single binary with no external dependencies, ensuring easy distribution across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.

### 2.2 Architecture Style

AcoustiCalc uses a layered architecture with the following components:
- Presentation Layer (TUI)
- Application Logic Layer (Calculator Engine)
- Audio Layer (Sound Feedback)
- Data Layer (History/Configuration)

### 2.3 Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Version | Purpose | Rationale |
|---------|------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Language | Go | 1.21+ | Primary development language | Performance, cross-platform compilation, single binary |
| TUI Framework | Bubble Tea | Latest | Terminal UI framework | Modern, feature-rich, active community |
| Audio Library | Oto | Latest | Cross-platform audio | Good cross-platform support |
| Testing | Go testing package | Bundled with Go | Unit and integration testing | Standard library, comprehensive coverage |

## 3. Component Design

### 3.1 Calculator Engine
- Responsible for parsing mathematical expressions
- Performs arithmetic operations
- Handles error validation
- Provides extensibility for advanced operations

### 3.2 TUI Layer
- Implements visual calculator layout
- Handles mouse events and keyboard input
- Manages UI state and rendering
- Provides responsive design for different terminal sizes

### 3.3 Audio System
- Plays sound effects for operations
- Manages audio configuration (volume, themes)
- Handles platform-specific audio implementations
- Provides fallback mechanisms

### 3.4 Configuration
- Manages user preferences
- Handles settings persistence
- Provides default configurations
- Supports customization options

### 3.5 History/Storage
- Stores calculation history
- Manages memory functions
- Provides persistence across sessions
- Implements efficient data storage

## 4. Data Models

### 4.1 Calculation
- Expression: string representation of the mathematical expression
- Result: computed result of the expression
- Timestamp: when the calculation was performed

### 4.2 Configuration
- AudioEnabled: boolean for audio feedback
- VolumeLevel: integer for volume control
- Theme: string for UI theme selection
- HistoryEnabled: boolean for history tracking

## 5. API Design

AcoustiCalc is a single binary application with no external API. All functionality is accessed through the TUI interface.

## 6. Security Considerations

- Input validation for mathematical expressions
- Secure handling of user configuration data
- No network communication, minimizing attack surface
- Safe audio file handling

## 7. Performance Requirements

- Startup time: < 1 second on all platforms
- Response time: < 100ms for all operations
- Memory footprint: < 50MB typical usage
- CPU usage: minimal during calculations

## 8. Deployment Architecture

### 8.1 Build Process
- Cross-platform compilation using Go
- Single binary output for each platform
- UPX compression for binary size optimization
- Automated GitHub Actions for releases

### 8.2 Distribution
- GitHub Releases for binary distribution
- Platform-specific packages (Homebrew, Scoop, AUR)
- Single binary installation with no dependencies

## 9. Testing Strategy

### 9.1 Unit Testing
- Calculator engine logic testing
- Individual component functionality verification
- Edge case and error condition testing

### 9.2 Integration Testing
- TUI interaction testing
