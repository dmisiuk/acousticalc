# 9. Testing Strategy

## 9.1 Unit Testing
- Calculator engine logic testing
- Individual component functionality verification
- Edge case and error condition testing
- Visual coverage reporting with screenshot evidence
- Test artifact generation and storage

## 9.2 Integration Testing
- TUI interaction testing
- Audio system integration verification
- Cross-platform behavior validation
- Component interaction validation with visual evidence
- Screenshot comparison and baseline management

## 9.3 Visual Testing (Epic 0)
