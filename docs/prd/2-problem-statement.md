# 2. Problem Statement

## Core Problem:
Terminal users are forced to choose between power and usability when it comes to calculator tools.

## Key Pain Points:
- Terminal calculator UX is primitive - most tools (bc, dc) require memorizing syntax
- No modern interaction methods - lack of mouse support in terminal environment
- Poor accessibility - limited multi-modal input/output options
- Fragmented ecosystem - users need multiple tools for different calculation types
- Steep learning curve - traditional tools prioritize power over usability
