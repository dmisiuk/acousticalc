# 7. Risks and Dependencies

## Key Risks:

**Technical Risks:**
- TUI Framework Mouse Support - Not all Go TUI frameworks have robust mouse event handling
- Cross-Platform Audio - Terminal audio capabilities vary significantly across platforms
- Terminal Compatibility - Different terminals have varying feature support
- Performance - Audio processing and TUI rendering may impact responsiveness

**Project Risks:**
- Scope Creep - Feature expansion beyond initial MVP
- User Adoption - Convincing users to try a new terminal calculator
- Maintenance Burden - Long-term sustainability as a solo project
- Community Building - Attracting contributors to an OSS project

**Market Risks:**
- Competition - Established tools (bc, dc) have strong user loyalty
- Niche Appeal - Terminal calculator with mouse may be too specialized
- Platform Changes - Terminal ecosystems evolve over time

## Critical Dependencies:

**Technical Dependencies:**
- Go Ecosystem - Reliance on Go language and package ecosystem
- TUI Framework - Third-party UI library (Bubble Tea/tview)
- Audio Libraries - Cross-platform audio support (Oto/Beep)
- GitHub Platform - Complete dependence on GitHub infrastructure

**External Dependencies:**
- Terminal Emulators - Varying capabilities across terminals
- Operating Systems - Platform-specific audio and UI behaviors
- Package Managers - Third-party distribution (Homebrew, Scoop, AUR)

## Mitigation Strategies:

**Technical Mitigations:**
- Framework Validation - Prototype mouse and audio features early
- Graceful Degradation - Fall back to basic functionality when features unsupported
- Comprehensive Testing - Test across multiple terminals and platforms
- Modular Design - Isolate risky components for easier replacement

**Project Mitigations:**
- MVP Focus - Start with essential features only
- Clear Roadmap - Public project board with planned features
- Documentation - Comprehensive docs to lower contribution barriers
- Automated Processes - GitHub Actions to reduce maintenance overhead

**Community Mitigations:**
- Low Barrier to Entry - Clear contribution guidelines and templates
- Fork-Friendly License - MIT License encourages community ownership
- Transparent Development - Public roadmap and decision-making
- Responsive Maintenance - Prompt issue and PR responses

## Dependencies to Validate:

**High Priority:**
- Mouse event handling in chosen TUI framework
- Cross-platform audio feasibility in terminal environment
- Multi-platform Go builds with all required features

**Medium Priority:**
- Terminal compatibility across popular terminals
- Package manager acceptance for distribution
- Performance characteristics with audio enabled
