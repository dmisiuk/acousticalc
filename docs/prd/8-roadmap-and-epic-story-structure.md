## Epic/Story Methodology Notes:

**Story Structure:**
- All stories follow "As a [user], I want [goal], So that [benefit]" format
- Each story includes clear acceptance criteria and tasks
- Stories are sized to complete within 1 week maximum
- Stories deliver user-facing value independently

**Epic Structure:**
- Epics contain 2-5 related stories that deliver cohesive value
- Each epic has clear goal, value statement, and definition of done
- Epics align with product phases but focus on user outcomes
- Epic completion delivers significant user value

**Advantages over Milestone approach:**
- User-centric focus rather than technical task orientation
- Clear value delivery in each story
- Better stakeholder communication through user stories
- Easier to prioritize and re-sequence based on user feedback
- Natural fit with agile development practices

## Key Dependencies & Timeline Risks:

**Critical Path Items:**
- TUI framework mouse support validation (Epic 1)
- Cross-platform audio implementation (Epic 2)
- Multi-platform CI/CD setup (Epic 1)

**Epic Dependencies:**
- Epic 2 depends on Epic 1 foundation
- Epic 3 depends on Epic 2 v1.0 release
- Future epics build on community established in Epic 3

**Contingency Time:**
- 1 week buffer for technical challenges per epic
- 2 weeks buffer for community building (Epic 3)
