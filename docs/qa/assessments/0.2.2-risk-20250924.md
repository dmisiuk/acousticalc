Date: 2025-09-24
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 4
- Medium Risks: 1
- Low Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 62/100 (Moderate Risk)

## High Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Visual Library Integration Complexity

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Multiple external Go libraries (`robotgo`, `imaging`, `lipgloss`) plus system dependencies (`ffmpeg`, `asciinema`, `ImageMagick`) create integration complexity
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Integration failures could delay implementation but existing native tools provide fallback
**Mitigation**:
- Implement incremental integration approach with fallbacks
- Validate all dependencies in development environment setup
- Create abstraction layer to isolate external library dependencies
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests for each library, fallback mechanism validation

### 2. TECH-002: Cross-Platform Screenshot Inconsistency

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - macOS `screencapture`, Linux `scrot/gnome-screenshot` have different capabilities and output formats
**Impact**: High (3) - Visual artifacts must maintain professional consistency across platforms for demo content
**Mitigation**:
- Create unified screenshot abstraction with format standardization
- Implement PNG/sRGB normalization pipeline
- Extensive cross-platform validation in CI matrix
**Testing Focus**: Platform-specific screenshot validation, format consistency tests, visual diff regression testing

### 3. PERF-001: Visual Testing CI Time Impact

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Screenshot capture, image processing, and artifact generation are inherently time-consuming operations
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Story specifies <30 seconds additional CI time constraint
**Mitigation**:
- Implement parallel image processing workflows
- Selective visual testing based on code changes
- Optimize image compression and processing algorithms
- Cache visual baselines to reduce processing
**Testing Focus**: CI time measurement, performance profiling, load testing of artifact generation

### 4. OPS-001: Visual Artifact Storage Growth

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Screenshots, demo content, and baselines will accumulate rapidly across test runs
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Unconstrained growth leads to storage costs and repository bloat
**Mitigation**:
- Implement automated cleanup policies (retention periods)
- Artifact compression and deduplication strategies
- Separate storage for temporary vs. permanent artifacts
- Size monitoring and alerting thresholds
**Testing Focus**: Storage growth simulation, cleanup automation testing, artifact lifecycle validation

## Medium Risk Items

### TECH-004: Unix-First Windows Compatibility Gap

**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Windows implementation relies on CI validation rather than native tooling
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could limit Windows developer experience but doesn't block functionality
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive Windows CI testing matrix
- Windows-specific compatibility testing
- Documentation of Windows limitations and workarounds
**Testing Focus**: Windows CI validation, cross-platform artifact compatibility testing

## Low Risk Items

### TECH-003: External Dependency Availability

**Score: 3 (Low Risk)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - `ffmpeg`, `ImageMagick` are standard tools with broad availability
**Impact**: High (3) - Missing dependencies would completely block visual processing features
**Mitigation**:
- Dependency validation in setup scripts
- Graceful degradation when dependencies unavailable
- Clear documentation of system requirements
**Testing Focus**: Dependency validation testing, graceful degradation scenarios

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- Technical: 4 risks (4 high, 0 critical)
- Performance: 1 risk (1 high)
- Operational: 1 risk (1 high)
- Security: 0 risks
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks

### By Component
- Screenshot System: 2 risks (TECH-001, TECH-002)
- CI/Performance: 2 risks (PERF-001, TECH-004)
- Artifact Management: 1 risk (OPS-001)
- System Dependencies: 1 risk (TECH-003)

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **Visual Library Integration**: Mock external dependencies, fallback mechanism validation
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Screenshot format validation across macOS/Linux/Windows
- **Performance Validation**: CI time measurement, parallel processing verification
- **Storage Management**: Artifact lifecycle automation, cleanup policy testing

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **Windows Compatibility**: CI matrix validation, Windows-specific edge cases
- **Dependency Management**: System requirement validation, error handling

### Priority 3: Standard Coverage Tests
- **Functional Testing**: Basic screenshot capture, artifact generation
- **Integration Testing**: Test framework integration with Story 0.2.1 foundation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- TECH-001: Visual library integration must have working fallbacks
- TECH-002: Cross-platform screenshot consistency must be validated
- PERF-001: CI time constraint must be met (<30 seconds additional)
- OPS-001: Storage growth must have automated controls

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-004: Windows compatibility acceptable with CI validation
- TECH-003: Dependency failures acceptable with graceful degradation

### Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- CI execution time trends for performance regression detection
- Storage growth rates and cleanup effectiveness
- Cross-platform artifact consistency validation
- External dependency availability and fallback usage rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- External library versions change significantly
- Platform support requirements expand
- CI infrastructure changes
- Storage architecture modifications
- Performance requirements change

---

**Overall Assessment**: Moderate risk profile with manageable high-risk items. Primary focus should be on cross-platform consistency and performance optimization to meet story constraints.
