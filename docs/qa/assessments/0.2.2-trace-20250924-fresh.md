### Critical Gaps

**No critical gaps identified** - All requirements have comprehensive test coverage.

### Minor Enhancement Opportunities

1. **E2E Integration Validation**
   - Current: Integration tests cover individual components
   - Enhancement: Complete end-to-end user journey validation
   - Risk: Low - All components individually validated

2. **Load Testing for Artifact Storage**
   - Current: Storage monitoring implemented in `comprehensive_nfr_test.go`
   - Enhancement: Large-scale storage growth simulation
   - Risk: Low - Cleanup policies and monitoring in place

### Test Design Quality Assessment

**Excellent Requirements Coverage:**
- Every acceptance criterion has multiple test levels (unit, integration, system)
- Critical paths validated through comprehensive NFR testing
- Edge cases covered through platform compatibility tests
- Performance requirements validated with real metrics

**Strong Given-When-Then Clarity:**
- All test mappings have clear preconditions, actions, and assertions
- Test isolation properly maintained
- Dependencies between tests properly managed

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - All P0 requirements fully covered
- **Medium Risk**: None - All P1 requirements fully covered
- **Low Risk**: All requirements have robust coverage with multiple test levels

**Test Evidence Quality:** All tests provide concrete evidence with measurable assertions and proper error handling.

### Implementation Validation

**Test Files Providing Evidence:**
- 8 comprehensive test files in `tests/visual/`
- 1 integration test file in `pkg/calculator/`
