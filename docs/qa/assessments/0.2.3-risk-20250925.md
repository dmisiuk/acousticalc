## Medium Risk Items

### TECH-003: Recording Storage and Artifact Growth

**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - E2E recordings will be larger than screenshots from Story 0.2.2
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Storage growth affects artifact management and CI performance
**Mitigation**:
- Extend Story 0.2.2's artifact management system with recording-specific cleanup
- Implement smart compression strategies for terminal recordings

**Testing Focus**: Storage growth simulation, compression efficiency validation, cleanup automation testing

### TECH-004: Platform-Specific Test Flakiness

**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - E2E tests may behave differently across platforms due to timing, UI rendering, etc.
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Flaky tests reduce CI reliability and developer confidence
**Mitigation**:
- Implement robust wait strategies and timing controls
- Create platform-specific timeout configurations
- Build comprehensive retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Establish baseline performance expectations per platform
**Testing Focus**: Test stability validation, timing sensitivity analysis, retry mechanism verification

## Low Risk Items

### DATA-001: Recording Metadata Consistency

**Score: 3 (Low Risk)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Metadata format is controllable through implementation
**Impact**: High (3) - Inconsistent metadata affects demo infrastructure integration
**Mitigation**:
- Define standardized metadata schema for all recordings
- Implement metadata validation and normalization
- Create comprehensive metadata extraction and storage
- Build metadata consistency verification tools
**Testing Focus**: Metadata schema validation, cross-platform consistency verification

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **E2E Framework Resilience**: Test framework behavior under failure conditions, platform isolation, graceful degradation
- **Cross-Platform Recording Validation**: Validate recording format consistency, quality metrics, metadata preservation across all platforms
- **CI Performance Testing**: Validate E2E execution stays within 30s constraint, test parallel execution efficiency
- **Dependency Management Testing**: Test CI environment setup, dependency validation, fallback behavior

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **Storage Management Testing**: Test artifact cleanup, compression efficiency, storage growth monitoring
- **Test Stability Analysis**: Run E2E tests multiple times per platform to identify flakiness patterns
- **Timing Sensitivity Testing**: Validate platform-specific timeout configurations and retry mechanisms

### Priority 3: Standard Coverage Tests
- **Functional E2E Testing**: Standard user journey validation
- **Platform Compatibility Testing**: Basic cross-platform behavior validation
- **Integration Testing**: Integration with existing Story 0.2.2 visual testing infrastructure

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- TECH-001: E2E framework must have robust error handling and fallbacks
- TECH-002: Cross-platform recording consistency must be validated with quality metrics
- PERF-001: CI time constraint must be maintained (<30 seconds additional)
- OPS-001: All CI environments must have reliable dependency management

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-003: Storage growth acceptable with automated monitoring and cleanup
- TECH-004: Test flakiness acceptable with retry mechanisms and platform baselines

### Accepted Risks
- DATA-001: Metadata inconsistency acceptable with validation tools in place

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- CI execution time trends across all platform combinations
- E2E test success rates per platform to identify platform-specific issues
- Recording artifact storage growth and cleanup effectiveness
- Test flakiness rates and retry mechanism usage
- Dependency installation success rates across CI environments

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- New platforms added to CI matrix
- Recording tools or dependencies change versions
- Performance constraints change
- CI infrastructure changes significantly
- Test framework architecture modifications

---

**Overall Assessment**: Moderate risk profile with manageable high-risk items. Primary focus should be on cross-platform consistency and performance optimization to maintain Story 0.2.2's successful patterns while extending to E2E testing.
