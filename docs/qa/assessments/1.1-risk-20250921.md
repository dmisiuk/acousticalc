## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy | Residual Risk | Owner | Timeline |
| :------ | :---------- | :---------- | :----- | :---- | :------- | :------------------ | :------------ | :---- | :------- |
| TECH-003 | Flawed CI Workflow Configuration | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Use official GitHub Actions documentation for Go CI; Validate YAML syntax with a linter; Test CI workflow on a feature branch before merging to main. | Low | Dev | During implementation of story 1.1 |
| TECH-001 | Incorrect Repository Setup | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Ensure correct GitHub repository creation settings. | Low | Dev | During implementation of story 1.1 |
| TECH-002 | Invalid Go Module Initialization | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Follow Go module initialization best practices. | Low | Dev | During implementation of story 1.1 |
| OPS-001 | Missing Essential Files | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal | Ensure all required files (README, LICENSE, templates) are created. | Minimal | Dev | During implementation of story 1.1 |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

None.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-003: Flawed CI Workflow Configuration**: Verify CI passes on initial push; Introduce a small, intentional error to confirm CI failure.
- **TECH-001: Incorrect Repository Setup**: Manual verification of repository settings.
- **TECH-002: Invalid Go Module Initialization**: Verify `go.mod` and `go.sum` are correctly generated.
- **OPS-001: Missing Essential Files**: Manual verification of file presence and content.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All identified risks can be deployed with the proposed mitigation strategies.

### Accepted Risks

None.

## Monitoring Requirements

- Monitor CI/CD pipeline for build and test failures.

## Risk Review Triggers

- Significant changes to project setup or CI/CD configuration.
