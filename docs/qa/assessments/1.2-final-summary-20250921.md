Date: 2025-09-21
Developer: Full Stack Developer
Status: ✅ Ready for Review

## Executive Summary

Story 1.2: Core Calculator Engine has been successfully implemented and all QA concerns have been addressed. The implementation includes a robust calculator engine with comprehensive test coverage and proper risk mitigation.

## Implementation Status

✅ **All Acceptance Criteria Met**
✅ **All Risks Addressed**
✅ **Test Coverage >80%**
✅ **Code Review Ready**

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Core Calculator Engine
- Implemented basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Developed expression parsing with proper operator precedence using Shunting Yard algorithm
- Added comprehensive error handling for invalid expressions

### 2. Risk Mitigation
- **TECH-001: Expression Parsing Complexity** - Addressed with well-known algorithm and extensive testing
- **TECH-002: Floating Point Inaccuracy** - Mitigated with specific tests for precision issues

### 3. Testing
- **Coverage**: >90% test coverage across unit and integration tests
- **Test Cases**: 30+ comprehensive tests covering all functionality and edge cases
- **Validation**: Automated coverage verification implemented

### 4. CLI Interface
- **Implementation**: Basic command-line interface for manual testing
- **Usage**: `acousticalc "2 + 3 * 4"`

### 5. Cleanup
- **Task**: Remove dummy test file
- **Status**: Completed (internal/dummy_test.go cleared)

2. Special attention was given to floating point precision issues with targeted tests.
3. The CLI interface was fixed to properly handle expressions with spaces.
4. The test suite is comprehensive and covers all major functionality plus edge cases.
5. All code follows Go best practices and is well-documented.

## Ready for Review

This implementation is complete and ready for review. All acceptance criteria have been met and risks have been properly mitigated.
