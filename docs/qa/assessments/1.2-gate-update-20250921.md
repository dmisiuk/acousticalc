Date: 2025-09-21
Author: Test Architect & Quality Advisor

## Overview

This document records the update to the quality gate status for Story 1.2: Core Calculator Engine. The gate status has been confirmed as PASS with all acceptance criteria met and all identified risks addressed.

## Changes Made

### 1. YAML Gate Document Alignment

The YAML version of the gate document (`docs/qa/gates/1.2-calculator-engine.yml`) was updated to align with the markdown version:

- Updated quality score from 85 to 90
- Updated AC coverage to include all acceptance criteria [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] with no gaps
- Updated timestamp to reflect the latest review
- Updated status reason to match the comprehensive assessment

### 2. Timestamp Synchronization

Both the markdown and YAML versions now have synchronized timestamps reflecting the current review.

## Verification

All acceptance criteria have been verified as met:

1. ✅ The calculator engine can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
2. ✅ The engine can parse and evaluate simple mathematical expressions
3. ✅ The engine has unit test coverage greater than 80% (currently >90%)
4. ✅ The engine provides clear error messages for invalid expressions
5. ✅ A basic CLI interface exists to manually test the engine's functionality
6. ✅ The dummy test file `internal/dummy_test.go` has been removed

## Risk Status

All identified risks have been addressed:

- TECH-001: Expression Parsing Complexity - Mitigated through implementation of well-known algorithm and extensive testing
- TECH-002: Floating Point Inaccuracy - Mitigated with specific tests for precision issues

## Quality Gate Status

**Status: PASS**

The implementation meets all requirements with comprehensive test coverage and proper risk mitigation. No further action is required.
