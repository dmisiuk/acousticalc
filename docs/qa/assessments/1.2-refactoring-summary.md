# Refactoring Summary: Story 1.2 - Core Calculator Engine

Date: 2025-09-21
Author: Test Architect & Quality Advisor

## Overview

This document summarizes the test architecture improvements implemented for Story 1.2: Core Calculator Engine. The refactorings focused on improving maintainability, consistency, and automation of the test suite.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Table-Driven Tests for Basic Arithmetic Operations

**Before**: Four separate test functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
**After**: Single table-driven test function that covers all basic arithmetic operations.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier to add new test cases
- Improved maintainability
- Follows Go testing best practices

### 2. Consolidated Expression Parsing Tests

**Before**: Four separate test functions for different expression parsing scenarios.
**After**: Single table-driven test function that covers all expression parsing scenarios.

**Benefits**:
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier to add new test cases
- Improved maintainability

### 3. Consistent Error Handling in Tests

**Before**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across test functions.
**After**: All error handling tests now follow a consistent pattern with early returns.

**Benefits**:
- Improved test consistency
- More predictable error handling
- Easier to maintain and understand

### 4. Automated Coverage Verification

**Before**: Coverage verification required environment variables to run.
**After**: Coverage verification runs automatically as part of the standard test suite.

**Benefits**:
- Ensures coverage is always verified
- Removes manual step that could be forgotten
- Improves quality assurance process

## Test Results

- All tests pass successfully
- Test coverage: 91.5% (exceeds required 80%)
- CLI functionality verified and working correctly

## Quality Improvements

- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved through table-driven tests and consistent patterns
- **Readability**: Enhanced through consistent structure and reduced duplication
- **Extensibility**: Easier to add new test cases with table-driven approach
- **Reliability**: Automated coverage verification ensures consistent quality checks

## Files Modified

1. `pkg/calculator/calculator_test.go` - Refactored basic arithmetic and expression parsing tests
2. `pkg/calculator/calculator_coverage_test.go` - Updated coverage verification approach
3. `docs/qa/refactoring-opportunities.md` - Updated to reflect completed refactorings
4. `docs/qa/gates/1.2-calculator-engine.md` - Updated quality gate with resolution of TEST-001 issue

## Verification

All refactorings have been verified to maintain existing functionality:
- Unit tests pass with 91.5% coverage
- CLI interface works correctly
- No regression in functionality
