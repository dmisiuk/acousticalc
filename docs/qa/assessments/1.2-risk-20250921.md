Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Status: Ready for Review

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 2
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Medium Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 85/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Expression Parsing Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Parsing logic, especially with operator precedence, is a common source of bugs.
**Impact**: High - Incorrect calculations would undermine the core functionality of the application.
**Mitigation**:

- Implement a well-known algorithm for expression parsing (e.g., Shunting-yard).
- Create extensive unit tests covering a wide range of expressions and edge cases.
  **Testing Focus**: Focus on complex expressions with mixed operators, parentheses, and negative numbers.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 2 risks (1 high)

### By Component

- Backend: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                    | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Expression Parsing Complexity  | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| TECH-002 | Floating Point Inaccuracy      | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Test scenarios for complex expressions with multiple operators and parentheses.
- Test edge cases like division by zero, leading negatives, and empty expressions.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Tests for floating point precision with known problematic calculations.
- Standard functional tests for all basic arithmetic operations.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks must have a clear mitigation and testing plan.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls (e.g., documenting known precision limitations).
