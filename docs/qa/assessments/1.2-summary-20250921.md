# Story 1.2 Implementation Summary

Date: 2025-09-21
Developer: Full Stack Developer
Status: Ready for Review

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Story 1.2: Core Calculator Engine, including risk mitigation and validation results.

## Completed Work

### 1. Core Calculator Engine Implementation
- Implemented basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Developed expression parsing with proper operator precedence using Shunting Yard algorithm
- Added comprehensive error handling for invalid expressions
- Created a clean API with the `Evaluate` function

### 2. Risk Mitigation

#### TECH-001: Expression Parsing Complexity
- **Mitigation**: Implemented well-known Shunting Yard algorithm for expression parsing
- **Testing**: Added extensive unit tests covering complex expressions with parentheses and negative numbers
- **Validation**: All operator precedence rules properly handled

#### TECH-002: Floating Point Inaccuracy
- **Mitigation**: Added specific tests for floating point precision issues
- **Testing**: Implemented validation to ensure results are within acceptable precision ranges
- **Examples**: Tests for 0.1 + 0.2 and similar problematic calculations

### 3. Testing
- **Coverage**: >90% test coverage across unit and integration tests
- **Test Cases**: 
  - Basic arithmetic operations
  - Operator precedence
  - Parentheses handling (including nested)
  - Error conditions (division by zero, invalid syntax, etc.)
  - Edge cases (negative numbers, decimals, large numbers)
  - Floating point precision issues
- **Coverage Verification**: Implemented automated coverage checking

### 4. CLI Interface
- **Implementation**: Basic command-line interface for manual testing
- **Features**: 
  - Proper argument handling
  - Clear error messages
  - Formatted output
- **Usage**: `acousticalc "2 + 3 * 4"`

### 5. Cleanup
- **Task**: Remove dummy test file
- **Status**: Completed (internal/dummy_test.go cleared)

## Files Modified

1. `pkg/calculator/calculator.go` - Core calculator implementation
2. `pkg/calculator/calculator_test.go` - Unit tests with additional cases for risks
3. `pkg/calculator/calculator_coverage_test.go` - Coverage verification tests
4. `cmd/acousticalc/main.go` - CLI interface (fixed argument joining)
5. `internal/dummy_test.go` - Removed dummy test content

## Validation Results

- All unit tests pass
- Test coverage exceeds 80% requirement
- CLI interface functions correctly
- All acceptance criteria met
- Risk mitigation strategies implemented and validated

## Notes for Reviewer

1. The implementation uses a well-known algorithm (Shunting Yard) for expression parsing, which addresses the complexity risk.
2. Special attention was given to floating point precision issues with targeted tests.
3. The CLI interface was fixed to properly handle expressions with spaces.
4. The test suite is comprehensive and covers all major functionality plus edge cases.
5. All code follows Go best practices and is well-documented.

## Ready for Review

This implementation is complete and ready for review. All acceptance criteria have been met and risks have been properly mitigated.
