# Quality Gate Decision: 1.2 - Calculator Engine

## Gate Status: PASS

## Story Information
- **Story**: 1.2 - Core Calculator Engine
- **Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)
- **Date**: 2025-09-21
- **Updated**: 2025-09-21T21:59:00Z

## Status Reason
The calculator engine implementation is well-structured and meets all acceptance criteria with comprehensive unit test coverage exceeding 90%. All critical process issues have been resolved: 1) The dummy test file has been completely removed, and 2) The story status has been updated to "Review". Additional test architecture improvements have been implemented to enhance maintainability.

## Quality Score: 90

## Evidence
- Tests reviewed: 25
- Risks identified: 2
- ACs covered: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
- ACs with gaps: []

## Top Issues

### 1. TEST-001: Coverage Verification Not Automated
- **Severity**: resolved
- **Finding**: Test coverage verification now runs automatically without requiring environment variables
- **Resolution**: Integrated coverage verification into standard test suite

## NFR Validation
- **Security**: PASS - No security concerns for calculator engine
- **Performance**: PASS - Performance requirements not specified for this story
- **Reliability**: PASS - Comprehensive error handling and edge case testing
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Improved test architecture with table-driven tests and consistent error handling

## Risk Summary
- Critical risks: 0
- High risks: 1 (TECH-001: Expression Parsing Complexity)
- Medium risks: 1 (TECH-002: Floating Point Inaccuracy)
- Low risks: 0

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Must fix before production)
- None - All critical issues have been resolved

### Future (Can be addressed later)
- Implement integration test for CLI interface (1.2-INT-001)
- Consider adding performance benchmarks for complex expressions
- Add more comprehensive negative number and boundary testing
- Update story status from "Draft" to "Review" (Completed)
- Completely remove `internal/dummy_test.go` file (Completed)

## Waiver
- Active: false
