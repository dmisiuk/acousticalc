story: '1.2'
story_title: 'Calculator Engine'
gate: PASS
status_reason: 'The calculator engine implementation meets all core acceptance criteria with comprehensive unit test coverage. Expression parsing complexity (the highest identified risk) is well mitigated through extensive testing of operator precedence and parentheses handling. Only minor gaps exist in integration testing and coverage verification.'
