# Story 0.1: GitHub Workflow & Issue Automation

## Story

**As a** developer working on AcoustiCalc
**I want** automated GitHub workflows that create issues and branches for new stories
**So that** every story follows consistent workflow and demo infrastructure is triggered automatically

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Automated Issue Creation**
   - Given a new story is planned
   - When the story development begins
   - Then a GitHub issue is automatically created with proper labels and templates

2. **Branch Management**
   - Given a story issue exists
   - When development starts
   - Then a feature branch is automatically created following naming convention `feature/story-X.Y-description`

3. **PR Template Integration**
   - Given a story branch exists
   - When a PR is created
   - Then PR template includes demo requirements checklist

4. **Workflow Triggers**
   - Given PR is created from story branch
   - When tests are run
   - Then demo infrastructure is automatically triggered

5. **Issue Linking**
   - Given a PR exists for a story
   - When PR is merged
   - Then the corresponding issue is automatically closed

- [ ] PR template includes demo requirements checklist
- [ ] All workflow triggers function correctly
- [ ] Issues automatically close when PRs merge
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Workflow tested on test repository
- [ ] Demo infrastructure triggers work end-to-end

## Technical Implementation

### GitHub Actions Workflows

**Issue Creation Workflow** (`.github/workflows/story-issue.yml`):
```yaml
name: Create Story Issue
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      story_id:
        description: 'Story ID (e.g., 1.3)'
        required: true
      story_title:
        description: 'Story Title'
        required: true
```

**Branch Creation Workflow** (`.github/workflows/story-branch.yml`):
```yaml
name: Create Story Branch
on:
  issues:
    types: [labeled]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

### PR Template

**Template Location**: `.github/pull_request_template.md`

**Required Sections**:
- Story reference and acceptance criteria
- Demo requirements checklist
- Testing verification
- Screenshots/video placeholders
- Breaking changes notice

### Branch Naming Convention

**Format**: `feature/story-{epic}.{story}-{description}`

**Examples**:
- `feature/story-0.1-github-workflow`
- `feature/story-1.3-tui-framework`
- `feature/story-2.1-audio-system`

## Dependencies

- GitHub repository admin access
- GitHub Actions enabled
- Issue/PR templates directory structure
- Basic understanding of GitHub workflow syntax

## Success Metrics

- 100% of new stories follow automated workflow
- Zero manual issue creation required
- PR template completion rate > 95%
- Workflow execution time < 30 seconds
- Zero workflow failures due to automation issues
