# Story 0.1: BMad Agent Development Workflow Automation

## Story

**As a** BMad development agent working on AcoustiCalc
**I want** to automate GitHub issue and branch creation using gh commands
**So that** I can quickly set up development environment for any story without manual steps

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Issue Creation Automation**
   - Given I want to start developing an existing story
   - When I run the BMad agent with story ID (e.g., "1.3")
   - Then the agent creates a GitHub issue using `gh issue create` with proper metadata

2. **Story Metadata Parsing**
   - Given an existing story file (e.g., `docs/stories/1.3.story.md`)
   - When the agent processes the specified story ID
   - Then it extracts story title, epic number, and acceptance criteria from the file

3. **Branch Creation Automation**
   - Given a GitHub issue has been created for the story
   - When the agent completes issue creation
   - Then the agent creates a feature branch `feature/story-X.Y-description` using `gh` commands

4. **Issue-Branch Linking**
   - Given both issue and branch exist
   - When the agent completes setup
   - Then the issue is linked to the branch and ready for development

5. **Developer Ready State**
   - Given issue and branch are created successfully
   - When the agent completes the setup process
   - Then I can immediately start coding on the prepared feature branch

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Story Metadata Parser** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create parser for story frontmatter (epic, story, title)
  - [ ] Extract acceptance criteria from story body
  - [ ] Validate story format and required fields
  - [ ] Handle parsing errors gracefully

- [ ] **GitHub CLI Integration** (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Implement `gh issue create` command generation
  - [ ] Add story metadata to issue body and labels
  - [ ] Implement `gh branch create` command generation
  - [ ] Handle branch naming convention `feature/story-X.Y-description`

- [ ] **Agent Workflow Logic** (AC: 4, 5)
  - [ ] Create agent workflow for story setup
  - [ ] Add error handling for gh command failures
  - [ ] Implement issue-branch association logic
  - [ ] Add success/failure notification system

- [ ] **Configuration Management**
  - [ ] Add repository and owner configuration
  - [ ] Implement label management (story, epic-X, status)
  - [ ] Add template support for issue creation
  - [ ] Configure branch protection rules integration

- [ ] **Testing and Validation**
  - [ ] Test with various story file formats
  - [ ] Validate gh command execution in different environments
  - [ ] Test error handling for network issues
  - [ ] End-to-end workflow testing

## Dev Notes

### BMad Agent Integration

### Agent Workflow
- **Trigger**: BMad dev agent initiates workflow when starting story implementation
- **Input**: Story ID provided by agent (e.g., "0.1", "1.3")
- **Process**: Agent executes gh commands directly for issue and branch creation
- **Output**: Ready-to-use issue and branch for agent to begin development

### Agent Benefits
- Eliminates manual GitHub CLI usage for agents
- Standardizes development setup across all stories
- Provides consistent issue tracking and branch naming
- Enables agents to focus on implementation rather than setup
- Works in any environment with gh CLI installed

### Technical Implementation
- Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) commands directly
- No GitHub Actions workflows required
- Agent executes commands in local environment
- Story metadata parsed from local files
- Branch and issue creation happens synchronously

### Previous Story Insights
- No previous story in Epic 0 - this is the foundation story for automated development workflow
- Establishes GitHub automation patterns for all subsequent story development

### GitHub CLI Context
**Source**: [architecture/tech-stack.md#development-tools]
- GitHub CLI available for repository management
- GoReleaser integration for multi-platform builds
- Existing development tools can be extended for story automation

### Project Structure Alignment
**Source**: [architecture/source-tree.md#directory-structure]
- Story files located in `docs/stories/` following `{epic}.{story}.story.md` pattern
- PRD files in `docs/prd/` with epic structure
- Integration with existing BMad core configuration

### CLI Integration Requirements
**Source**: [architecture/tech-stack.md#development-tools]
- GitHub CLI for issue creation and branch management
- Proper authentication and permission scoping
- Rate limiting and error handling for CLI commands

### Branch Strategy Integration
**Source**: Development workflow requirements
- Always create feature branches from latest `main`
- Follow naming convention: `feature/story-{epic}.{story}-{slug}`
- Ensure branch is ready for immediate development start
- Integration with existing PR workflow and quality gates

### Testing

**Source**: [architecture/9-testing-strategy.md#9.1-unit-testing, #9.2-integration-testing]
- Unit testing for story metadata parsing logic
- Integration testing for GitHub API interactions
- End-to-end testing for complete workflow automation
- Mock GitHub API for testing without live API calls
- Validate workflow with test repository setup

**Test Requirements**:
- Test manual workflow trigger with valid story IDs
- Validate GitHub issue creation with story metadata
- Test branch creation from main with naming conventions
- Error handling for non-existent story IDs
- Performance testing for workflow execution time
