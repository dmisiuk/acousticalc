# Story 0.1: PRD-Triggered GitHub Workflow Automation

## Story

**As a** developer working on AcoustiCalc
**I want** a GitHub workflow I can trigger when starting development on any story
**So that** GitHub issues and feature branches are created on-demand from latest main when I'm ready to code

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Manual Workflow Trigger**
   - Given I want to start developing an existing story
   - When I trigger the GitHub workflow with story ID (e.g., "1.3")
   - Then the workflow reads the story from existing files in `docs/stories/`

2. **Story Metadata Parsing**
   - Given an existing story file (e.g., `docs/stories/1.3.story.md`)
   - When the workflow processes the specified story ID
   - Then it extracts story title, epic number, and acceptance criteria from the file

3. **GitHub Issue Creation**
   - Given parsed story metadata
   - When the workflow executes
   - Then a GitHub issue is created with proper labels, template, and story details

4. **Feature Branch Creation**
   - Given a new GitHub issue for a story
   - When the workflow completes issue creation
   - Then a feature branch `feature/story-X.Y-description` is created from latest main

5. **Developer Ready State**
   - Given issue and branch are created successfully
   - When the workflow completes
   - Then I can immediately start coding on the prepared feature branch

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Manual Trigger Workflow** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow with `workflow_dispatch` trigger
  - [ ] Add story ID input parameter for manual triggering
  - [ ] Implement story file lookup in `docs/stories/` directory
  - [ ] Add validation for existing story file before processing

- [ ] **Story Metadata Parser** (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create parser for story frontmatter (epic, story, title)
  - [ ] Extract acceptance criteria from story body
  - [ ] Validate story format and required fields
  - [ ] Handle parsing errors gracefully

- [ ] **GitHub Issue Automation** (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Design issue template for story workflow
  - [ ] Implement GitHub API integration for issue creation
  - [ ] Add appropriate labels (story, epic-X, status)
  - [ ] Link issue to parsed acceptance criteria

- [ ] **Branch Management Automation** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement branch naming convention `feature/story-X.Y-description`
  - [ ] Ensure branch creation from latest main branch
  - [ ] Handle branch name conflicts and sanitization
  - [ ] Add branch protection and PR requirements

- [ ] **Developer Ready Integration** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Configure workflow completion notifications
  - [ ] Add issue-branch linking for easy discovery
  - [ ] Create simple trigger documentation (CLI or GitHub UI)
  - [ ] Test end-to-end workflow: trigger → issue → branch → ready to code

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- No previous story in Epic 0 - this is the foundation story for automated development workflow
- Establishes GitHub automation patterns for all subsequent story development

### GitHub Actions Context
**Source**: [architecture/tech-stack.md#development-tools]
- GitHub Actions already configured for CI/CD pipeline
- GoReleaser integration for multi-platform builds
- Existing workflow infrastructure can be extended for story automation

### Project Structure Alignment
**Source**: [architecture/source-tree.md#directory-structure]
- Story files located in `docs/stories/` following `{epic}.{story}.story.md` pattern
- PRD files in `docs/prd/` with epic structure
- `.github/workflows/` directory for GitHub Actions workflows
- Workflow integration with existing BMad core configuration

### Manual Trigger Strategy
**Source**: [.bmad-core/core-config.yaml]
- Read from `devStoryLocation: docs/stories` when story ID provided
- Look up existing story files using pattern `{epic}.{story}.story.md`
- Integration with existing story numbering convention for branch naming

### API Integration Requirements
**Source**: [architecture/tech-stack.md#development-tools]
- GitHub API for issue creation and branch management
- Proper authentication and permission scoping
- Rate limiting and error handling for API calls

### Branch Strategy Integration
**Source**: Development workflow requirements
- Always create feature branches from latest `main`
- Follow naming convention: `feature/story-{epic}.{story}-{slug}`
- Ensure branch is ready for immediate development start
- Integration with existing PR workflow and quality gates

### Testing

**Source**: [architecture/9-testing-strategy.md#9.1-unit-testing, #9.2-integration-testing]
- Unit testing for story metadata parsing logic
- Integration testing for GitHub API interactions
- End-to-end testing for complete workflow automation
- Mock GitHub API for testing without live API calls
- Validate workflow with test repository setup

**Test Requirements**:
- Test manual workflow trigger with valid story IDs
- Validate GitHub issue creation with story metadata
- Test branch creation from main with naming conventions
- Error handling for non-existent story IDs
- Performance testing for workflow execution time
