# Story 0.2.1: Core Testing Framework (Unit + Integration)

## Story

**As a** developer working on AcoustiCalc
**I want** enhanced testing infrastructure building upon existing unit tests to provide comprehensive coverage reporting, test organization, and integration testing capabilities
**So that** I can verify calculator functionality and component interactions with structured testing framework and visual evidence

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Enhanced Coverage Reporting**
   - Given existing calculator unit tests exist (from Story 1.2)
   - When I run enhanced test coverage analysis
   - Then comprehensive visual coverage reports with HTML output and trend tracking are generated

2. **Test Organization Structure**
   - Given existing tests are in package directories (from Story 1.2)
   - When I reorganize testing infrastructure
   - Then structured `tests/` directory with separate unit/integration/e2e sections is created

3. **Integration Testing Framework**
   - Given basic unit tests are already implemented
   - When I create integration tests
   - Then component interaction testing framework with mock objects and test fixtures is established

4. **Unix-First Testing Optimization**
   - Given existing CI runs on all platforms (from Story 1.1)
   - When I optimize testing experience
   - Then Unix-specific test utilities, local development workflow, and performance monitoring are enhanced

5. **Test Artifact Management Foundation**
   - Given basic test execution exists
   - When I implement artifact management
   - Then basic organization system for test results, coverage reports, and future visual evidence is created
