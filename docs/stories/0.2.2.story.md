# Story 0.2.2: Visual Testing & Artifacts

## Story

**As a** developer working on AcoustiCalc
**I want** comprehensive visual testing capabilities with automated artifact generation building on Story 0.2.1's testing framework
**So that** I can capture visual evidence of test execution, generate professional demo materials, enable visual regression detection, and achieve >95% test coverage with visual validation

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Visual Testing Integration with Existing Framework**
   - Given Story 0.2.1's testing framework is operational
   - When I integrate visual testing capabilities
   - Then visual artifacts are generated for unit and integration tests with <30 seconds additional CI time

2. **Screenshot Capture System**
   - Given tests are executing on Unix systems (macOS/Linux)
   - When test events occur (start, pass, fail)
   - Then automated screenshots are captured using native utilities with proper PNG/sRGB formatting and metadata

3. **Visual Evidence and Demo Content Generation**
   - Given unit and integration tests complete
   - When visual processing runs
   - Then comprehensive visual artifacts are generated including HTML reports, test timelines, and professional demo materials

4. **Cross-Platform Visual Artifact Management**
   - Given visual artifacts are generated on Unix
   - When artifacts are stored and accessed
   - Then they maintain compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux with organized directory structure and metadata tracking

5. **Visual Testing Quality Gates**
   - Given visual testing implementation is complete
   - When quality validation runs
   - Then >95% test coverage with visual evidence is achieved with zero infrastructure-related test failures
