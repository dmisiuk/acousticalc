# Story 0.2.2: Visual Testing & Artifacts

## Story

**As a** developer working on AcoustiCalc
**I want** visual testing capabilities with automated artifact generation on Unix systems
**So that** I can capture visual evidence of test execution, generate demo materials automatically, and enable visual regression detection

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Screenshot Capture System**
   - Given tests are running on Unix systems
   - When tests execute or fail
   - Then automated screenshots are captured with proper naming and storage

2. **Visual Test Evidence Generation**
   - Given unit and integration tests are running
   - When tests complete
   - Then visual artifacts (screenshots, logs, coverage) are automatically generated and organized

3. **Artifact Management System**
   - Given visual artifacts are being generated
   - When artifacts are created
   - Then they are organized, stored, and made accessible for review and demo purposes

4. **Unix-First Visual Tools**
   - Given Unix development environment
   - When visual testing is implemented
   - Then screenshot and capture tools work reliably on macOS and Linux

5. **Cross-Platform Artifact Compatibility**
   - Given visual artifacts work on Unix
   - When they are accessed or processed
   - Then they remain compatible and viewable across all platforms including Windows
