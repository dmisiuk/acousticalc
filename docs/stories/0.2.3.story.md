# Story 0.2.3: E2E & Cross-Platform Testing

## Story

**As a** developer working on AcoustiCalc
**I want** comprehensive end-to-end testing with full cross-platform validation and terminal recording
**So that** I can ensure complete application functionality works consistently across all supported platforms through CI-based testing with visual evidence

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **End-to-End Test Framework**
   - Given complete application workflows exist
   - When E2E tests execute
   - Then full user journeys are tested from start to finish with automated validation

2. **Cross-Platform CI Matrix**
   - Given E2E tests work on development systems
   - When tests run through GitHub Actions
   - Then all platforms (Ubuntu, macOS, Windows) validate consistent behavior

3. **Terminal Recording Integration**
   - Given E2E tests are executing
   - When user interactions occur
   - Then terminal sessions are recorded with input visualization, output capture, and demo-ready format generation

4. **Platform-Specific Testing**
   - Given different operating systems have unique characteristics
   - When E2E tests run
   - Then platform-specific behaviors and edge cases are validated

5. **Comprehensive Test Reporting**
   - Given E2E tests complete across all platforms
   - When results are aggregated
   - Then comprehensive cross-platform test reports with visual evidence are generated
