# Story 0.2: Testing Infrastructure Foundation

## Story

**As a** developer working on AcoustiCalc
**I want** comprehensive automated testing infrastructure (unit, integration, e2e, UI tests) with visual output capabilities
**So that** I can verify functionality and automatically generate test-based demos for every feature

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Enhanced Unit Testing**
   - Given existing unit tests exist
   - When I run enhanced unit tests
   - Then visual coverage reports are generated with screenshot evidence

2. **Integration Testing Framework**
   - Given calculator engine and UI components exist
   - When integration tests run
   - Then component interactions are tested with visual validation

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Given complete application workflows exist
   - When e2e tests execute
   - Then full user journeys are tested with terminal recordings

4. **UI Testing Framework**
   - Given TUI interface exists
   - When UI tests run
   - Then TUI states are captured and compared with baselines

5. **Visual Artifact Generation**
   - Given any test runs
   - When tests execute
   - Then screenshots and recordings are automatically generated

6. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Given tests run on different platforms
   - When testing on Windows, macOS, Linux
   - Then consistent test results and artifacts are produced

## Story Tasks

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Enhance existing unit testing with visual coverage
- [ ] Create integration testing framework for TUI components
- [ ] Implement end-to-end testing with terminal recording
- [ ] Build UI testing framework with screenshot comparison
- [ ] Create visual artifact generation system
- [ ] Set up cross-platform testing validation

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test visual artifact generation on all platforms
- [ ] Validate integration with existing CI pipeline
- [ ] Verify screenshot baseline creation and comparison
- [ ] Test terminal recording capabilities
- [ ] Validate test coverage reporting with visuals

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Document testing infrastructure usage
- [ ] Create visual testing guidelines
- [ ] Update CI documentation with visual testing
- [ ] Document screenshot baseline management
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for visual testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Unit tests generate visual coverage reports
- [ ] Integration tests capture component interaction screenshots
- [ ] E2E tests produce terminal session recordings
- [ ] UI tests create and compare screenshot baselines
- [ ] All tests generate visual artifacts automatically
- [ ] Cross-platform testing works consistently
- [ ] CI pipeline integrates visual testing
- [ ] Documentation covers all testing capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### Testing Framework Structure

```
tests/
├── unit/              # Enhanced unit tests with visuals
├── integration/       # Component integration tests
├── e2e/              # End-to-end workflow tests
├── ui/               # TUI screenshot testing
├── fixtures/         # Test data and scenarios
└── artifacts/        # Generated visual evidence
```

### Visual Testing Tools

**Screenshot Capture**:
- Terminal screenshot utilities
- TUI state capture with tcell/termbox
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Recording Capabilities**:
- Terminal session recording
- User interaction capture
- Audio sync preparation (for future audio system)

**Artifact Management**:
- Organized storage structure
- Baseline comparison system
- CI artifact upload

### Integration Points

- Extends existing `pkg/calculator` tests
- Leverages current CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Prepares for TUI framework integration (Story 1.3)
- Enables demo recording system (Story 0.3)

## Dependencies

- Existing unit test suite (from Story 1.2)
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (from Story 1.1)
- Go testing framework and tools
- Terminal screenshot/recording libraries

## Success Metrics

- >95% test coverage with visual evidence
- Zero test failures due to visual testing infrastructure
- <30 seconds additional test time for visual artifacts
- 100% cross-platform visual testing compatibility
- Automated visual regression detection
