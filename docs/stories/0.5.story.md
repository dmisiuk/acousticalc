### Enhanced Issue Templates

**Bug Report Template** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`):
```yaml
name: Bug Report
description: File a bug report with demo evidence
body:
  - type: textarea
    id: demo-evidence
    attributes:
      label: Demo Evidence
      description: Include screenshots, videos, or reproduction steps
      placeholder: |
        Please provide:
        - Screenshot of the bug
        - Video showing the issue (if applicable)
        - Steps to reproduce with expected vs actual behavior
    validations:
      required: true
```

**Feature Request Template** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml`):
```yaml
name: Feature Request
description: Suggest a new feature with demo planning
body:

    id: demo-plan
    attributes:
      label: Demo Planning
      description: How would this feature be demonstrated?
      placeholder: |
        Consider:
        - What would the demo video show?
