### Story

As a user, I want a basic calculator engine that can perform arithmetic operations, so that I can get results for my mathematical expressions.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  The calculator engine can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2.  The engine can parse and evaluate simple mathematical expressions (e.g., "2 + 3 * 4").
3.  The engine has unit test coverage greater than 80%.
4.  The engine provides clear error messages for invalid expressions (e.g., "2 +").
5.  A basic CLI interface exists to manually test the engine's functionality.
6.  The dummy test file `internal/dummy_test.go` is removed.

### Dev Notes

This story focuses on building the core logic of the calculator. It does not involve the TUI or audio systems.

**Previous Story Insights**:
*   A dummy test file (`internal/dummy_test.go`) was created in story 1.1 to ensure the CI pipeline passed. This file must be removed as part of this story, as it will be replaced by actual tests for the calculator engine.

**Technology Stack**:
*   **Language**: Go 1.21+ [Source: `docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#2.3-technology-stack`]
*   **Testing**: Go testing package [Source: `docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#2.3-technology-stack`]

**Data Models**:
*   **Calculation**:
    *   Expression: `string` [Source: `docs/architecture/4-data-models.md#4.1-calculation`]
    *   Result: `float64` (Assumed, no specific type defined in docs)
    *   Timestamp: `time.Time` [Source: `docs/architecture/4-data-models.md#4.1-calculation`]

**File Locations**:
*   No specific guidance found in architecture docs for file locations.
*   It is recommended to create a new package `pkg/calculator` for the engine logic.
*   Tests should be located in `pkg/calculator/calculator_test.go`.

**Testing Requirements**:
*   Unit tests must cover the calculator engine's logic, including edge cases and error conditions. [Source: `docs/architecture/9-testing-strategy.md#9.1-unit-testing`]
*   Test coverage must be >80%.

**Error Handling**:
*   The engine must provide clear error messages for invalid expressions. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-error-handling.md`]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **Create Calculator Package**:
    *   [x] Create a new directory `pkg/calculator`.
    *   (AC: 1, 2)

2.  **Implement Expression Parser**:
    *   [x] Implement a function to parse a string expression into a sequence of tokens.
    *   [x] Handle operator precedence (e.g., multiplication before addition).
    *   (AC: 2)

3.  **Implement Arithmetic Operations**:
    *   [x] Implement functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    *   (AC: 1)

4.  **Implement Evaluator**:
    *   [x] Implement a function to evaluate the parsed expression and return a result.
    *   (AC: 2)

5.  **Implement Error Handling**:
    *   [x] Add error handling for invalid expressions (e.g., division by zero, syntax errors).
    *   [x] Return meaningful error messages.
    *   (AC: 4)

6.  **Write Unit Tests**:
    *   [x] Write comprehensive unit tests for the parser, arithmetic operations, and evaluator.
    *   [x] Ensure test coverage exceeds 80%.
    *   (AC: 3)

7.  **Create Basic CLI**:
    *   [x] Create a simple `main.go` in `cmd/acousticalc/` that takes an expression as a command-line argument, evaluates it using the calculator engine, and prints the result or error.
    *   (AC: 5)

8.  **Cleanup**:
    *   [x] Remove the dummy test file `internal/dummy_test.go`.

### Notes for Review

All acceptance criteria have been met and all tasks completed:

1.  **Calculator Engine**: Implemented all basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
2.  **Expression Parsing**: Successfully implemented expression parsing with proper operator precedence using a Shunting Yard-like algorithm
3. **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for invalid expressions including division by zero, mismatched parentheses, and invalid syntax
4.  **Unit Tests**: Wrote comprehensive unit tests with >90% coverage, covering edge cases and floating point precision issues
5.  **CLI Interface**: Created a basic CLI interface for manual testing of the engine's functionality
6.  **Cleanup**: Removed the dummy test file `internal/dummy_test.go`

### QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of the calculator engine is well-structured and follows good Go practices. The code is clean, readable, and properly organized into logical functions. The use of the Shunting Yard algorithm for expression parsing is appropriate for this use case and demonstrates a solid understanding of the problem domain.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the code quality is already high.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Go best practices and conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Properly organized into pkg/calculator and cmd/acousticalc
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with unit and integration tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria have been addressed

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Calculator engine implements all basic arithmetic operations
- [x] Expression parsing with operator precedence correctly implemented
- [x] Comprehensive error handling for invalid expressions
- [x] Test coverage exceeds 80% requirement
- [x] CLI interface allows manual testing of the engine
- [x] Remove dummy test file `internal/dummy_test.go` completely (file has been removed)
- [x] Update story status from "Draft" to "Review" (status is already "Review" in frontmatter)

### Security Review

No security concerns identified for this calculator engine implementation. The application doesn't handle sensitive data or external inputs beyond mathematical expressions.

### Performance Considerations

Performance is adequate for a calculator engine. The implementation uses efficient algorithms for expression parsing and evaluation. No performance bottlenecks were identified in the code review.
