# Story 1.3: TUI Framework Integration

## Story

**As a** terminal user who wants a visual calculator interface
**I want** a Text-based User Interface (TUI) with mouse support and visual buttons
**So that** I can interact with the calculator using both keyboard and mouse in a familiar layout

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **TUI Framework Setup**
   - Given Bubble Tea framework is integrated
   - When the application starts
   - Then a visual calculator interface with buttons is displayed

2. **Mouse Support**
   - Given the TUI calculator is displayed
   - When I click on calculator buttons with the mouse
   - Then the corresponding operations are performed

3. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Given the TUI calculator is displayed
   - When I use keyboard shortcuts and navigation
   - Then I can operate the calculator without mouse

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Given user interactions occur
   - When buttons are clicked or keyboard shortcuts used
   - Then visual feedback shows button presses and state changes

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Given different terminal sizes
   - When the calculator is displayed
   - Then the interface adapts to terminal dimensions

## Demo Requirements (Epic 0 Integration)

**Automated Demo Generation:**
- [ ] Demo video showing mouse clicks on calculator buttons
- [ ] Video demonstrating keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- [ ] Before/after comparison with CLI-only version (Story 1.2)
- [ ] Visual input overlays showing mouse clicks and keypresses
- [ ] Multiple terminal size demonstrations

**Visual Proof Points:**
- Mouse interaction with TUI buttons
- Keyboard navigation between calculator functions
- Visual button press feedback
- Responsive design across terminal sizes
- Integration with existing calculator engine

## Story Tasks

### Implementation Tasks
- [ ] **Epic 0 Prerequisite Check**: Verify demo infrastructure is operational
- [ ] Integrate Bubble Tea TUI framework
- [ ] Design visual calculator button layout
- [ ] Implement mouse event handling for buttons
- [ ] Create keyboard navigation system
- [ ] Add visual feedback for button presses
- [ ] Implement responsive design for different terminal sizes
- [ ] **Demo Generation**: Create automated demo scenarios for TUI interactions

### Testing Requirements (Using Epic 0 Infrastructure)
- [ ] Unit tests for TUI components with screenshot validation
- [ ] Integration tests for mouse/keyboard interaction with visual proof
- [ ] UI tests comparing TUI state against baselines
- [ ] End-to-end tests recording full user workflows
- [ ] Cross-platform TUI testing with visual artifacts

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README with TUI screenshots and demo videos
- [ ] Document mouse support capabilities
- [ ] Create keyboard shortcuts reference
- [ ] Update architecture docs with TUI integration

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Epic 0 Dependency**: All demo infrastructure stories (0.1-0.5) completed
- [ ] Visual calculator interface displays correctly
- [ ] Mouse clicks work on all calculator buttons
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all functions
- [ ] Visual feedback shows user interactions clearly
- [ ] Interface is responsive to terminal size changes
- [ ] **Automated Demos**: PR includes embedded demo videos showing TUI functionality
- [ ] **Visual Testing**: Screenshot baselines established for UI regression testing
- [ ] All acceptance criteria demonstrated in video format
- [ ] Cross-platform functionality verified with visual proof

## Technical Implementation

### TUI Framework Integration
```go
// pkg/ui/calculator.go
type CalculatorModel struct {
    // TUI state and button layout
    buttons [][]Button
    selected Point
    display  string
    engine   *calculator.Engine
}

func (m CalculatorModel) Update(msg tea.Msg) (tea.Model, tea.Cmd) {
    // Handle mouse clicks and keyboard input
}

func (m CalculatorModel) View() string {
    // Render calculator layout
}
```

### Demo Scenarios (Epic 0 Integration)
1. **Basic TUI Demo**: Show visual calculator startup and button layout
2. **Mouse Interaction**: Demonstrate clicking buttons with visual feedback
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Show keyboard shortcuts and navigation
4. **Responsive Design**: Demonstrate different terminal sizes
5. **Integration Demo**: Show TUI + calculator engine working together

### Visual Testing (Epic 0 Infrastructure)
- Screenshot capture of calculator button layout
- Mouse click visualization with circle overlays
- Keyboard press overlays showing shortcuts
- Terminal resize demonstrations
- Before/after comparisons with CLI version

## Dependencies

- **CRITICAL**: Epic 0 (Demo Infrastructure) must be completed first
- Bubble Tea TUI framework
- Calculator engine from Story 1.2
- Mouse support in terminal emulator
- Demo recording system from Story 0.3

## Success Metrics

- Visual calculator interface works with mouse and keyboard
- 100% of user interactions provide visual feedback
- Interface responsive across all target terminal sizes
- Demo videos clearly show TUI advantages over CLI
- Zero regressions in calculator engine functionality
- Professional demo quality with input visualization
