    *Source: Milestone 1.3 - Mouse event handling validation*
4.  Keyboard navigation is supported for accessibility.
    *Source: Milestone 1.3 - Keyboard navigation*
5.  Basic visual feedback is provided for user interactions.
    *Source: Milestone 1.3 - Basic visual feedback*

### Dev Notes

This story focuses on integrating the TUI framework and creating the basic visual interface. It builds on the calculator engine from Story 1.2.

**Previous Story Insights**:
*   Story 1.2 successfully implemented a complete calculator engine with expression parsing, arithmetic operations, and comprehensive error handling.
*   The calculator engine is located in `pkg/calculator/` and provides functions for evaluating expressions.
*   A basic CLI interface exists at `cmd/acousticalc/main.go` for testing the engine.

**Technology Stack**:
*   **Language**: Go 1.21+ [Source: `docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#2.3-technology-stack`]
*   **TUI Framework**: Bubble Tea (Latest) [Source: `docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#2.3-technology-stack`]
*   **Testing**: Go testing package [Source: `docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#2.3-technology-stack`]

**Component Design**:
*   **TUI Layer**: Implements visual calculator layout, handles mouse events and keyboard input, manages UI state and rendering, provides responsive design for different terminal sizes [Source: `docs/architecture/3-component-design.md#3.2-tui-layer`]

**Architecture Style**:
*   **Presentation Layer**: TUI interface [Source: `docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#2.2-architecture-style`]
*   **Application Logic Layer**: Calculator Engine (from Story 1.2) [Source: `docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md#2.2-architecture-style`]

**File Locations**:
*   **TUI Package**: Create `pkg/tui/` for TUI-related code
*   **Main Application**: Update `cmd/acousticalc/main.go` to launch TUI instead of CLI
*   **Tests**: Create `pkg/tui/tui_test.go` for TUI-specific tests

**Testing Requirements**:
*   **Unit Testing**: Individual component functionality verification [Source: `docs/architecture/9-testing-strategy.md#9.1-unit-testing`]
*   **Integration Testing**: TUI interaction testing [Source: `docs/architecture/9-testing-strategy.md#9.2-integration-testing`]
*   **Manual Testing**: Mouse interaction testing, user experience validation [Source: `docs/architecture/9-testing-strategy.md#9.3-manual-testing`]

**Key Implementation Notes**:
*   Use Bubble Tea framework for TUI implementation
*   Design calculator button layout (0-9, +, -, *, /, =, C, etc.)
*   Implement mouse event handling for button clicks
*   Add keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
*   Provide visual feedback for button presses and active states
*   Integrate with existing calculator engine from `pkg/calculator/`

**Error Handling Strategy**:
*   Calculator engine errors → Display in TUI with clear messaging
*   Invalid input → Visual feedback without crashing
*   Terminal resize → Graceful layout adjustment
*   Missing dependencies → Graceful degradation or clear error messages

**Success Metrics**:
*   Mouse clicks register correctly on all buttons
*   Keyboard navigation covers all functions
*   Visual feedback latency < 100ms
*   Test coverage >85% for new TUI code
*   TUI works on terminals as small as 80x24 characters

**Implementation Example**:
```go
// In TUI model update function
case tea.MouseMsg:
    if msg.Type == tea.MouseLeft {
        // Handle button clicks
        button := getButtonAtPosition(msg.X, msg.Y)
        if button != nil {
            // Update calculator state
            calcState = processButtonPress(button, calcState)
        }
    }
```
